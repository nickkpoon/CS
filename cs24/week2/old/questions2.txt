Week 2 problems: C++

Remember to solve these individually, working with your partner only when
you get stuck, and seeking help from the TA only when you are both stuck.

This is part of your assignment for the week, not just for the day, so it is 
expected that you may not finish during this lab time.  

For each problem, make sure you write your answer exactly on the line with 
the problem number (i.e. 1a) that follows the question.

For example, if the question looks like this:
0.  What is the last name of the instructor for this class?
0)

The answer should look like this:
0.  What is the last name of the instructor for this class?
0) Franklin

If it is fill in the blank, it would start like this:
0) The last name of the instructor for this class is ___________.

And the answer would look like this:
0) The last name of the instructor for this class is Franklin.

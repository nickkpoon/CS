1) in C++, functions that are associated with a class are called instance methods.

2) A data type is to a variable as a class is to an object.

3) Bringing together data and functions into a single unit, as well as restricting access to them, is called encapsulation.

4) Restricting access to data, code, and implementation details is called abstraction.

5) The constructor with no input arguments is called the default constructor.

6) If you create an array of objects, as opposed to an array of pointers to objects, you may only use the move constructor.

7) If you have a line of code like this:  Card c = d; the copy constructor will be called.

8) In c, in order to group variables together in a single unit, you use a struct.

9) When compiling separate files, the first 7 characters of the header file should be #ifndef.
